*A patch for Kega Fusion, made to improve the overall user experience*

This project is made mostly to change the design, do some fixes, and make the modding scene more active for this emulator.

## History
BetterKega born via a old translation project of mine, which don't exists anymore.

So, with this, anyone can translate and even help with the project! Since Kega Fusion is easy to decompile and reverse-engineer (even ResourceHacker can do this!), I started this project with some improvements in mind.

> Obviously, some things are broken (like the file history). If you know how to fix anything wrong with BetterKega or have a feature suggestion, please help with a issue or a pull request. You're always welcome!

## How to install
First, you need to have [ResourceHacker] on your PATH. There is a plenty of tutorials on how to do this. Put the program on a ``%RESHACKER%`` variable in PATH to make the patcher work.

Now you need to have the emulator itself. There is a download link for this emulator on the official website:
- [Carpe Ludum] (download here, Fusion 3.6x)

Now, you will have to clone this repository using [Git] using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucmsilva651/BetterKega
```
Also, you can go to the green ``"Code"`` thing on the top of this page and click on the ``"Download ZIP"`` button.

Now, you have this structure:
```
- BetterKega
- Fusion364.zip
```
Start extracting the ``"Fusion364.zip"`` file inside of the BetterKega folder.

Now it is easy! Just open the ``"Install.cmd"`` file.

## Post-install
If you want to run BetterKega again after installation, just go inside the ``"Fusion364"`` folder and open the ``"Fusion.exe"`` file, or just use the ``"Open BetterKega.cmd"`` script to open BetterKega.
